about: "Hi, I'm Jordan and I've been working in the IT industry in Melbourne for the last 8 years. I've worn many hats in many different roles, primarily focused on web based solutions. My latest role has been working at a start-up I co-founded called The Big Crunch, where I developed several web applications over the full stack leading a small team."

    description: "At The Big Crunch I was head of engineering working developing a new collaborative spreadsheet with Elixir, NodeJS, RocksDB, React and Redis. The Big Crunch was a challenging project to work on and unfortunately we couldn't find product market fit, after discovering this we pivoted to a new product called Fickle (https://fickleit.com). I built Fickle from scratch using an event sourced model using NodeJS, React, EventStore and Docker."
