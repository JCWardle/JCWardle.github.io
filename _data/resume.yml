    date: "January 2018 - Today"
    description: "At The Big Crunch I started as a fullstack engineer working in Elixir, NodeJS, React and an assortment of other frontend JavaScript frameworks. 6 Months into my journey at The Big Crunch I became co-founder. The Big Crunch was a challenging project to work on, intitally the product was an infinite spreadsheet that enabled our customers to collaborate on formula's, data and other mixed content. It was an extreme challenge to get the system to scale correctly. Ultimately we did pivot to a new product called Fickle (https://fickleit.com). I built Fickle from scratch using an event sourced model using NodeJS, React, EventStore and Docker."
