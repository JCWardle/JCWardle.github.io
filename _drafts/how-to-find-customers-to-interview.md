# How to find customers to interview

Finding customers to interview for your new product or service can be a real challenge. Here's a few standard and creative ways of reaching people for interviews. 

## Paying / Not paying
Paying with gift vouchers is difficult when working with customers in different countries
Paypal or Google pay can be a good option as well.
The price you pay depends on the type of customer your going with, make sure you offer a price that will work for them. If you're targeting corporate executives be prepared to pay more compared to interviewing primary school teachers.
