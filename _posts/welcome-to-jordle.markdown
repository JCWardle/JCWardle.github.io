Hello and welcome, I'm Jordan Wardle a software developer based in Melbourne. I've been in the industry for 8 years now.

This is my first blog post I've taken the plunge and finally decided to build a blog.

Previously I've wrriten a few blog posts on Medium, and Dev.to. I've decided to make my own blog now so I can learn more about running a blog.

My ambitous plan for 2020 is to write 1 blog post a week about some technology I'm working on at The Big Crunch or something I learnt during the week. I'll be covering software development, tech startups and SEO.

Please stick around, follow me on twitter.
