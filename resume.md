I'm Jordan a software developer based in Melbourne, Australia.

I am currently working at The Big Crunch (https://www.bigcrunch.io) where we are trying to take over the world of data.

I previously worked at an IT consultancy for 3 years while I was working on a side project called Bumble Metrics. Bumble Metrics was my first step into product development and startups.

Before that I worked at a digital messaging company after I finished studying at Swinburne University in Melbourne.
